      <description>Why? I always wanted to have a place where I can share longform writing without the restrictions of the mainstream plaftorms (like Medium, Wordpress and others) or the hassle of maintaining a self-hosted blogging platform like WordPress.org or Ghost and having to deal with security vulnerabilities.
What am I gonna post here? Tutorials that are requested on my Discord and some helpful information that can be used to educational purposes, either in the gaming, streaming or software development world.</description>
